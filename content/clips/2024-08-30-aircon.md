Christian talks about what he did when an airconditioning system powered by a cheap android tablet needing a $1,697 repair when the tablet inevitably stopped working.

> Forcing customers to replace an entire system just because the cheapest component failed might be really profitable, I have no ideaâ€¦ But I do know that it annoyed me enough to make me want to fix it myself.

It's very cool that he was able to fix this himself, but deeply frustrating that he had to. Thermostats have historically been pretty simple, and it's bizarre to see how quickly a "smart" one becomes "unfixable."
