I really like green space in cities, so it's sad to hear about some being destroyed. At least it's for affordable housing and not like luxury shopping or office space or something.

> But after 12 years of struggle between the city and garden advocates, on June 18, 2024, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled six to one that the City of New York could destroy it to build a mix of affordable housing, luxury retail and office space in its place.

Ah well, anyways.

> In other words, the situation is quite different from how it is officially portrayed. It is not just that supporters of green space in general, abstract terms, will be disappointed by not getting some green space. It is that an existing, beloved place will be cut out of the body of this neighborhood, irreparably.
