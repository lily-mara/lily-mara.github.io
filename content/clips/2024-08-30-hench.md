I recently went to the [Kill James Bond] live show in London, and it was so much fun! There were some guys there dressed as contractors from "Hench," the fictional gig-economy app the podcast hosts predicted would be the future of henchman employment. In addition to their costumes, they were telling people to try out their new tabletop RPG "Hench," inspired by the podcast and tongue-in-cheek Bond lore. I haven't had a chance to playtest it yet, but I am excited to.
