This article is very unsurprising to me as a SF resident, I love SF so much but I do dislike how sleepy the city seems to be. When I go somewhere that has late night options, I barely know what to do with myself.

> San Francisco is one of the best food cities in the United States. That is, as long as you plan on an early-bird special.

> According to one new report, whose findings echo years of anecdotal complaints about the difficulty of finding a hot meal after 9 p.m. in this town, San Francisco is the worst major city in the country for late-night dining.
