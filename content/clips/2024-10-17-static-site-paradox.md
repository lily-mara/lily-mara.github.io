> And so, while we software engineers enjoy free hosting & custom domain support with GitHub Pages / Cloudflare Pages / etc, normal users are stuck with a bunch of greedy clowns that make them pay for every little thing, all while wasting ungodly amounts of computational power to render what could have been a static website in 99% of cases.

Yes, this is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about in my original [IndieWeb](/posts/2024/07/technoelitism) post:

> I believe that we should have better on-ramps to letting people control their own digital presence. It's super easy to make a Twitter/Facebook/TikTok account because somebody gets a little bit richer every time a new account is created. There will never be this same kind of financial incentive for the IndieWeb, because if there were it wouldn't be "indie" anymore. As a movement, we should think about making things that are _actually_ easy for people to do, rather than superficially easy. There's a massive amount of IndieWeb publishing tools that are targeted at developers (we can kinda roll with the punches when a tool isn't all-the-way-there), but not quite so much for less-savvy users.

Where is the one-click setup for creating a lightweight SSG-powered website? Where's the non-developer-focused free hosting for it? Things like this are how we move the needle.
