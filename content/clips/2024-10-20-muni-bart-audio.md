> To Whom It May Concern:
>
> Pursuant to the California Public Records Act, I hereby request the following records:
>
> Any and all available audio recordings of announcements - i.e. RE schedules, health notices, schedule interruptions, promotions, emergencies - and other audio material created to be broadcast to transport patrons on trains, buses, light rail, in stations, and from outdoor shelters. I am specifically requesting the audio recording material and not the transcripts or other summarized format of these recordings.

This is awesome, someone filed Freedom of Information Act requests with [BART](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/california-52/munibart-voice-announcement-audio-recordings-san-francisco-bay-area-rapid-transit-132836/) and [SF MUNI](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/san-francisco-141/munibart-voice-announcement-audio-recordings-san-francisco-municipal-transportation-agency-132837/) to get all of their onboard audio announcements! This is things like stop names, line names, MUNI has complex special service annoucements, I had some fun purusing this.

The MUNI archive is quite large so I'm not going to host it here directly, but these are both direct download links from muckrock.com's CDN.
