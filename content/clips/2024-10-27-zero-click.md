> Platforms like Facebook and Twitter stopped promoting posts with links a few years ago. This forced users on those platforms to post content directly there instead of directing followers to external sites.

I detest this behavior in social media platforms. Instagram in particular is the most frustrating of these platforms, since you functionally cannot post a link on IG. It puts a cap on creativity, a limit on how you can express yourself. Anything that doesn't fit within the box of "an image" or "a short video" is just entirely inaccessible via IG. Considering the reach of these platforms, that content may as well not exist for vast swaths of people. Are we ready to concede that much of human expression to big tech firms? I'm not.
