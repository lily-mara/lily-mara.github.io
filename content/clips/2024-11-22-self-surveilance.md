> Your life in numbers and rows. It’s all laid out like a spreadsheet, everything has to be accounted for. If only you can optimize further and buy the products to track and hit the optimal range, everything will be fine, right? Everything will change once you tackle this one thing.

> The numbers prove it: you. are. bad. It doesn’t matter how hard you try, how you were sick, burnt out, busy, allowing yourself to rest or explore other things. Your streak is gone. What you built your self confidence on is crumbling.

Life cannot really be measured, but people will sell you the ability to measure _something_. As we know, if you start measuring things, especially things that you have been sold as "important," many people will [make efforts to optimize for those things](https://www.forbes.com/councils/theyec/2018/12/04/you-are-what-you-measure/).

It's hard to build a computer program to measure "time spent with friends outside on a nice day," or "times you made a stranger smile." Even if you could measure things like that, people would have to accept that there are a lot of days when you can't do them, when you can't have a perfect little streak of perfect little days tied up with a bow. Life is messy and chaotic and beautiful and if you reduce it to numbers, you've lost something really important.
