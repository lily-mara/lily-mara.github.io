> PyMySkySpy shows a map of your flightpath so far. It also shows your current flight metrics and how these metrics have changed over the course of your flight. It does this for all data available from the in-flight wi-fi, even data that isnâ€™t usually displayed on the website or headrest screen.

I love this project, I've long wanted to build something that scuttles away the data generated by infotainment systems while traveling. When I was in Europe this summer (post about that still forthcoming), I considered building something similar that logged data from the DB train info system so I could build a profile of my whole travel journey and know things like the top speed of the whole trip. I also appreciated Robert's dedication to making his project as low-impact as possible on the info server (though I definitely wouldn't have bothered to do this).

Robert also created [PySkyWiFi], another delightful project.
