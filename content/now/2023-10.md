Mostly right now I'm decompressing after some stuff

- Speaking at [QCon SF](https://qconsf.com/presentation/oct2023/sleeping-scale-delivering-10k-timers-second-node-rust-tokio-kafka-and-scylla)
- Finishing move to new apartment with partner, wow the views are so pretty here
- Watching shared custody doggie while ex was at conference (why yes, i _am_ gay actually)
- Quarterly planning @work

I'm focusing on

- Independent web content
- Being thoughtful with how I spend my time & brainpower
- Exploring new parts of SF
- Writing more just for the sake of it
- Unpacking boxes

What's next?

- I'm putting together a proposal for a Rust video course with O'Riley
