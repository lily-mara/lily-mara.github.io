Things are starting to feel a bit more normal after moving.

- Started reading [Blood in the Machine](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/brian-merchant/blood-in-the-machine/9780316487740/?lens=little-brown) - a very interesting book comparing the labor squeeze and consolidation of power surrounding the industrial revolution to the monopolistic behavior of big tech companies today
- Playing in the [San Francisco Queer Pinball League](https://www.instagram.com/sfqpl/)'s new season
- Taking pictures of the pretty views
- Tending to an old knee injury that's flared up on me
- Small contributions to [Omnivore](https://github.com/omnivore-app/omnivore/), my read-it-later/RSS app of choice
- Drafting a blog post about a custom LED controller
