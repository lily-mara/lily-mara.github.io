- Finished reading [Blood in the Machine](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/brian-merchant/blood-in-the-machine/9780316487740/?lens=little-brown)
- Writing a blog post about a project - building an always-on transit departure dashboard with Rust and an old Kindle
- Adjusting to some big life changes
- Trying to organize residents of my building into a co-op
- Probably going to keep playing pinball after the SF Queer Pinball League wrapped up (I finished 5th!)
- Going on a company skiing trip next week, hopefully my old skydiving knee injury won't stop me from skiing
