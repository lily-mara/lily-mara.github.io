I went to this festival on a whim after finding out about it from the [Wikipedia page on Red Hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_hair#Red_hair_festivals). It was really cute and fun, I was happy that I got the chance to go. A guy from Reuters interviewed me, and the interview got [clipped by an Australian news channel!](https://youtu.be/2K15k0yk5k0)

## Rotterdam
