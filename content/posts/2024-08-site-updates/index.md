I've recently been motivated to make some improvements to this site, in the hopes that it might become a more ready place for me to do public writing. Some of those changes you may have noticed, some not.

# The [Clips] section

Motivated by other online writers, particularly [Tracy Durnell], I created a place to share short thoughts on interesting articles or websites that I've found. This will probably be a much higher-volume source of content than my normal blog posts, so read on if you'd like to exclude yourself from these updates.

# New homepage

I've wanted to change up the homepage for a while, now it's showing off multiple kinds of posts and directing folks to the most recent blog posts/now/clip entries that I've posted.

# Multiple RSS Feeds

This was technically always available, but I never publicized it before. The new [RSS Feeds] page shows the different RSS feeds that you can subscribe to, along with my expected writing volume on each of these. If you don't want your RSS reader clogged with my Clippings, you can unsubscribe from the main feed and subscribe specifically to the [long-form post RSS feed].

[RSS Feeds]: /pages/feeds/
[long-form post RSS feed]: /posts/index.xml
