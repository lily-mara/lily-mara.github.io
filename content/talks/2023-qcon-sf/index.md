I spoke at QCon San Francisco with my colleague [Hunter
Laine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hunter-laine/) about a high-performance timer
system that we built at OneSignal with Rust, Tokio, and Scylla.

A recording of the talk should be released on the [QCon
Website](https://qconsf.com/presentation/oct2023/sleeping-scale-delivering-10k-timers-second-node-rust-tokio-kafka-and-scylla)
on October 20th.
